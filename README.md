# Smart Nightlight Motion System (Tinkercad + Arduino)
A motion-activated smart lighting prototype built on Tinkercad using Arduino Uno, PIR sensor, and slide switch.  
- Lights remain OFF during daytime.  
- At night: lights stay DIM to save power.  
- On motion detection: lights turn FULL BRIGHT for 5 seconds, then return to dim.  
- Demonstrates power saving using duty cycle analysis.
